This is where all training content resides, organized into subdirectories that identify each training module.

To create a new module:

1. Copy "template-course" to a new directory. The directory name should start with the string "course-" and have a unique name that reflects the course title.

2. Use Jupyter Notebook to open the templated Jupyter Book and build out the course content. Each page can be a markdown or Jupyter Notebook file added to the Jupyter Book. The template includes instructions for how to put things together.

3. Create a pull request to have your new additions added to the upstream repository. This triggers automation to generate publish your content, including adding a link to the training page at operate-first.cloud.
