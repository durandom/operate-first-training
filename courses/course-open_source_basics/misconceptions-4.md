## Misconception 4: It's a free-for-all

<br/>

**Misconception:** *It's open source, so I can do whatever I want with it.*

While open source does support the [free software](freesoftware.md) concept, **it also conforms to a license**.

Each open source project adopts an open source license that describes the conditions for using and redistributing the code. One common condition is that it must be redistributed with that same license.

To ensure you follow the project's license, see the **LICENSE.TXT** and **README** files inside the project's code repositories.
