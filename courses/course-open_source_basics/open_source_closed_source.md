# Open source vs. closed source

The **open source** concept started as a classification of software based on its license.

An **open source license**:

* Makes the software's source code legally available to end users without any additional cost.

* Allows users to make any changes to the software that they want.

* Provides for repurposing and redistributing the source code provided that the same license follows that original source.

This is very different from **closed source** software, which is:

* Highly guarded and only legally accessible to a retricted set of users.

* Only available for end users, not for modification or redistribution.
