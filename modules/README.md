This is where all training content resides, organized into subdirectories
that identify the skill area for each training module.

To create a new module:

1. Open the appropriate skill-based subdirectory for the new module.

2. Create a new directory there with a unique name that reflects what you're
creating.

3. Use Jupyter Notebook and Juputer Book as needed to create the content
designed to generate one or more HTML pages. Be sure to test with a local
HTML build.

4. Set up automation (CI/CD) to generate publish your content... FIXME more information to come.
